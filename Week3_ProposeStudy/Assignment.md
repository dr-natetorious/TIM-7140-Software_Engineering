# Propose an Emprical Study

## A: Propose a research study

Your next task will be to design the collection and analysis process you would use to perform this study. You will not be asked to implement this study. Some points you should address in your design include:

- Define the process to collect this data. Your collection process must be clearly defined and architected.
- What do you hope to discover from this dataset? What software engineering issues will you solve?
- Why is this dataset needed? Explain why this dataset would be useful.
- How will it be constructed. What technologies would you be using?
- What challenges must be overcome in the creation of this dataset?
- Provide a brief literature review of similar studies.

This design and rationale should provide the reader confidence that your proposed empirical analysis provides significant value from a research perspective, and that your plan could be reasonably implemented.

Length: 6-8 pages, not including title page and references

References: Support your proposal with at least five scholarly sources.

Your paper should demonstrate thoughtful consideration of the ideas and concepts presented in the course by providing new thoughts and insights relating directly to this topic. Your response should reflect graduate-level writing and APA standards. Be sure to adhere to Northcentral University's Academic Integrity Policy.

## B: Present the idea

The second part of your submission will be to prepare a PowerPoint presentation, in which you do the following:

1. Discuss the research questions the study would address.
2. How would you execute the study? What technologies would you use?
3. Discuss the challenges your study would encounter.
4. Who would want to use this dataset? How would others use it? How would you make it publicly available?

Incorporate appropriate animations, transitions, and graphics as well as speaker notes for each slide. The speaker notes may be comprised of brief paragraphs or bulleted lists.

Support your presentation with at least five scholarly resources. In addition to these specified resources, other appropriate scholarly resources may be included.

Length: 12-15 slides

Notes Length: 150-200 words for each slide (in lieu of speaker notes, you may record a video of yourself delivering the presentation and submit a link to where the video can be viewed)

Be sure to include citations for quotations and paraphrases with references in APA format and style where appropriate. Save the file as PPT with the correct course code information.
