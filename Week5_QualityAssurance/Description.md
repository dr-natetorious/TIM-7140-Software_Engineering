# Software Quality Assurance

The world is plagued with poor quality software. A single defect or issue in software far too frequently hinders good ideas. Software defects are no longer merely an issue that affects only a few users or a software development team. Defects are often front-page news, which are capable of wreaking major havoc – everything from causing an app to close prematurely to bringing down an airliner or shutting off a power grid. While ensuring software quality is not usually a glamorous task, it is one that is imperative to the software development process.

Ensuring software quality is not a simple, or one-time task. Steps to ensure quality need to be built into every faucet of the software development lifecycle. A robust testing suite is typically comprised of a variety of tests, which often include:

1. **Unit Testing**: Small, automated tests that test single methods or procedures.
2. **Equivalence Partitioning**: A testing technique that divides the input data of a software unit into partitions of equivalent data from which test cases can be derived.
3. **Boundary Value Analysis**: Tests that are designed to include representatives of boundary values in a range.
4. **Acceptance Testing**: A level of testing that is conducted to determine if the requirements of a specification or contract are met according the customer’s requirements.
5. **Usability Testing**: A process to designed to understand how real users experience a website or application.
6. **Regression Testing**: A type of software testing designed to verify that software previously developed and tested still performs correctly after it was changed or interfaced with other software.

This week, you will focus on learning about current trends in software quality assurance. You will focus on understanding the following: **a)** challenges in software quality assurance; **b)** quality assurance and testing strategies; and **c)** the impact that defects have on a user’s perception of the software.
