# Examine A Quality Assurance Case Study

For this task, you will examine several key challenges to software quality assurance, recent developments and practices in quality assurance, and the impact that poor quality has on a software user. Unfortunately, many software projects take quality assurance for granted, thus leading to poor quality software and failed software projects. Your initial step is to find a recent (less than 2 years old) defect, which has had a significant impact on well-known software system. This defect may have security, reliability, functional, or usability impacts. You will then perform a case study on the defect and create an analysis document where you address the following:

1. **Determine why the problem occurred**: Understand the root cause of the issue from a technical and process perspective, and what steps led to the problem occurring. You should also explore if other software systems are susceptible to this type of defect.
2. **Explain the gaps in the testing process that led to this issue**: Large software systems typically have a quality assurance process.  What were the gaps in this process? Why did they occur?
3. **Analyze how this problem was addressed**: When this issue was discovered, how did the software organization react in resolving the issue. Did they address the problem in a proper way? What improvements could have been made to the remediation process for a technical or process perspective?
4. **Determine how this issue should be addressed**: Using research papers published in the last 3 years, define a cutting-edge process for the following: a) building quality into the design of the software; b) what testing processes may be used to discover this defect; and c) you should clearly argue why the proposed process will be efficient and effective for eliminating a similar defect in future software releases.
