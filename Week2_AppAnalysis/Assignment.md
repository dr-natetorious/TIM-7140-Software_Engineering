# Conduct an Empirical Analysis on an Existing Dataset

For this task, use the dataset provided by (Krutz D. , et al., 2015), and then perform an empirical analysis to determine the following:

- Which app genres contain the most under- and over-privileges?
- Is there is a correlation between an app’s security and quality metrics?
- Is there is a correlation between the number of committers an app has, and its permission misuse?
- Propose and conduct a new empirical analysis on this data set using a research question you propose.
- Write a report documenting your findings. Your analysis, findings, and other relevant information should be documented in a clear fashion, which will allow others to clearly and easily reproduce your findings on the provided dataset.

The referenced work by (Krutz D. , et al., 2015) provides information on all related terminality in the assignment.
