# Reproduce an Experiment

At the beginning of the course, you learned about several leading software engineering conferences. For this task, you will select a full paper, which was accepted at one of these venues during the past year, and then recreate a published experiment in an effort to gain a greater understanding of the methods utilized therein. Once you have selected an interesting paper, you should address the following:

- Describe the issue addressed. Why is it important? Is this an agreed-upon concern?
- Describe what the study accomplished. What was not achieved?
- Describe the methodology the study utilized. Was it appropriate? Justify your response.
- Describe the study results and the contribution they made to the body of knowledge, if any.
- Describe possible extensions to the research, if any. In what ways can the study be enhanced or modified to provide additional value? Discuss any limitations or assumptions held within the study and how they can be addressed.
- Present the studyâ€™s experiment that will be reproduced. Be sure to outline the setup and resources utilized.
- Describe how you will reproduce the experiment. How does your experiment differ from the original? In what ways were they the same? How do your results compare with the original results and what conclusions can be drawn with the additional data provided by your experiment?
- Finally, reproduce the experiment and document the setup, procedure, and results. Create any tables, graphs, raw results, or aggregate reports that would allow for direct comparison with the original study.
