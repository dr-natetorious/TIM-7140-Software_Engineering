# Compare Software Engineering Models

For this assignment, you must develop a matrix that identifies the features, constraints, purpose, and use of many common engineering models, and then compares the similarities and differences between each model.

Include the following software engineering models in your matrix:

- Waterfall (SDLC)
- Rapid Software Development (ASD)
- Extreme Programming
- Spiral Model
- DevOps
- Rapid Application Development (RAD)
- Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)
- Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)
- Prototype Approach
- Lean Software Development (LSD)

Length: 2-3 pages with matrix, not including title page and references.

The completed assignment should demonstrate thoughtful consideration of the ideas and concepts presented in the course by providing new thoughts and insights relating directly to this topic. Your response should reflect graduate-level writing and APA standards. Be sure to adhere to Northcentral University's Academic Integrity Policy.
