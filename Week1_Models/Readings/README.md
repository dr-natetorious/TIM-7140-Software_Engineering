> Software Engineering aims to produce a quality software product that is delivered on time, within the allocated budget, and with the requirements expected by the customer but unfortunately maximum of the times this goal is rarely achieved. A software life cycle is the series of identifiable stages that a software product undergoes during its lifetime. However, a properly managed project in a matured software engineering environment can  consistently achieve this goal.
