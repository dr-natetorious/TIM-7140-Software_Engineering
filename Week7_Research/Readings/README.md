> The choice of research strategy is not “good” or “bad” a priori but is very much dependent on the setting and goal of the research. A biologist may be interested in studying the behavior of elephants in groups, for example, in which case a visit to the jungle is warranted, with a considerable lack of
control of variables (and the elephant’s behavior) as an inherent consequence. On the other hand, a researcher may be interested in studying parts of an elephant, such as the structure of its skin, in which the continuous and immediate access that a zoo offers is more appropriate. Besides ease
of access, the zoo environment offers a potentially higher degree of control of measurement of the variables that a researcher might be interested in. However, this comes at the inherent cost of a less realistic context.
