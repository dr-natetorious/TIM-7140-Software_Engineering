## A Reactive Batching Strategy of Apache Kafka for Reliable Stream Processing in Real-time (2020)

H. Wu, Z. Shang, G. Peng and K. Wolter, "A Reactive Batching Strategy of Apache Kafka for Reliable Stream Processing in Real-time," 2020 IEEE 31st International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE), Coimbra, Portugal, 2020, pp. 207-217, doi: 10.1109/ISSRE5003.2020.00028. [KafkaStrategy.pdf](KafkaStrategy.pdf).

The authors examine different `message batching sizes` against `processing latency`.  They use this information to build an ANN that predicts optimal consumer configurations.  When systems are properly sized, they process messages much faster and more efficiently.
